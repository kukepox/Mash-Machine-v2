# Contributors
Reimo KÃ¤nd & Rajiv Dhanaraj - we will both be working on producing the prototype code.

Reimo created all the files and added the base structure ie defined a table in the HTML file and ran an animation via CSS file. 4 Boxes of differnt colors fall from the top of the screen.
In patch 1 Reimo added a javascript file which made the boxes clickable and ran the animation again everytime the block was clicked.

In patch 2 Rajiv added 4 CSS styled buttons pertainig to the box and it's color by editing the CSS file. Made the buttons work by now running the animation everytime the button is clicked. Also made the animation run an infinite loop to mimic how the game would run. Finally aligning all the elements and adding a horizontal line at the bottom (again to mimic the game).

# Framework used to develop the application
HTML; CSS; Javascript;

# Target platform(s) that the prototype will run on
Cross platform prototype: Windows, IOS, Android

* Guide to installing/running the application (this can be filled out later as your progress with developing your prototype). 
The prototyoe is an HTML page which gives input to the user and allows to push according buttons to simulate moving actual blocks on the machine. Can also be used as a visual input while using the real machine.
